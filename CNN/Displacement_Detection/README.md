This notebook focuses on displacement detection in images, specifically identifying changes such as scaling and rotation. It demonstrates how to detect these transformations in images using deep learning techniques. The exercise applies a model that detects displacement in images and analyzes the effects of scaling and rotation. Users will be guided through the process of training and testing the model, and the notebook includes practical examples with the detect_change.ipynb file to help users understand how these transformations impact image recognition and how to account for them in computer vision tasks.
