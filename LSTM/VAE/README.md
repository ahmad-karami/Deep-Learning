## Variational Autoencoder (VAE) & Conditional VAE (CVAE)

This notebook implements **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** and **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** models using deep learning.  
It covers the theoretical formulation, model architecture, training process, and qualitative evaluation of generated samples, demonstrating how conditional information improves generative performance.
