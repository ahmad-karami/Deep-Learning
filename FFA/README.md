# Feature-Field Alignment (FFA) Experiments
This repository contains two FFA-based experiments on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch: a supervised setup and an unsupervised setup. Both notebooks implement custom architectures and training procedures that encourage separation between positive and negative examples via energy-style objectives on feature activations.
