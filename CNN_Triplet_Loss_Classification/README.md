1. Binary_Classifier
  - The notebook demonstrates how to implement a fully connected Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The exercise focuses on using a simple CNN architecture with a fully connected layer to classify two types of images: airplanes and automobiles. The notebook explains the process of training the network, adjusting the weights, and calculating the cross-entropy loss. Additionally, it explores the importance of the training process across multiple epochs to minimize the loss function effectively.

2. Triplet_Loss_Feature_Extractor
  - The notebook explores the implementation of a Triplet Loss function for training a feature extractor in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The exercise focuses on replacing the traditional cross-entropy loss with triplet loss, which is useful for learning similarity between images. The process includes training a feature extractor, followed by incorporating the fully connected layer for classification. The notebook also provides instructions on how to use pre-trained weights and fine-tune the model for specific tasks such as image classification.

3. Triplet_Loss_And_Feature_Extraction
  - The notebook introduces the implementation of the Triplet Loss function in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction. Unlike the typical cross-entropy loss, triplet loss is used to optimize the model by learning embeddings that are close for similar images and far for dissimilar ones. The exercise involves training a feature extractor using triplet loss and integrating it with a fully connected layer for classification. It also demonstrates how to use pre-trained weights and fine-tune the model for specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between similar classes.
